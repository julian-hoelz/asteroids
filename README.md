# Asteroids

## Game Description

Asteroids is an arcade game where you navigate a spaceship around asteroids and shoot at them. When hit, they break into smaller pieces and eventually disappear. Occasionally, flying saucers appear and shoot at you, increasing the challenge. You score points by hitting asteroids and flying saucers with bullets.

## How to Play

Clone the GitHub repository. Open a terminal in that folder and type <code>python asteroids.py</code> to start the game. Press the Enter key to start playing. You can control the spaceship using the arrow keys or WASD. Use the spacebar to shoot. Have fun playing!

## About This Clone

If you download my Asteroids clone, youâ€™ll probably notice that while the gameplay is similar, some aspects have been handled differently from the original. For example, asteroids are generated randomly rather than following recurring patterns.
